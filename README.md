Used to read CSV files for live-data in overlays.<br>

    
2 core files modified. The notes & additions are inside the above provided files. These are _**ADDITIONS**_ to the existing files, not full replacements. Replacing the core files with these attached files **WILL BREAK YOUR ALLSKY** <br>
**/home/pi/allsky/scripts/config/config.sh<br>
/home/pi/allsky/scripts/saveImage.sh<br>**

I made a new folder in the /home/pi/allsky/scripts , called **mods**, where the main overlay.py lives, as well as a CSV file from my temperature logger, so it can be called via the run.
